title="Non-Data-Aided Feedforward Carrier Frequency Offset Estimators for QAM Constellations: A Nonlinear 
Least-Squares Approach",
journal="EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing",
year="2004",
volume="2004",
number="13",
pages="856139",
abstract="This paper performs a comprehensive performance analysis of a family of non-data-aided feedforward 
carrier frequency offset estimators for QAM signals transmitted through AWGN channels in the presence of 
unknown timing error. The proposed carrier frequency offset estimators are asymptotically (large sample) 
nonlinear least-squares estimators obtained by exploiting the fourth-order conjugate cyclostationary 
statistics of the received signal and exhibit fast convergence rates (asymptotic variances on the order of     
                                                                   , where                                     
                                    stands for the number of samples). The exact asymptotic performance of 
these estimators is established and analyzed as a function of the received signal sampling frequency, 
signal-to-noise ratio, timing delay, and number of symbols. It is shown that in the presence of intersymbol 
interference effects, the performance of the frequency offset estimators can be improved significantly by 
oversampling (or fractionally sampling) the received signal. Finally, simulation results are presented to 
corroborate the theoretical performance analysis, and comparisons with the modified Cram{\'e}r-Rao bound 
illustrate the superior performance of the proposed nonlinear least-squares carrier frequency offset 
estimators.",
