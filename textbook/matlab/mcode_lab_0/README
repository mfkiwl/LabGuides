This code is for ECE4305 lab0 and should contain:
- generateNoise.m
- loopback.m
- startup.m
along with the necessary Pluto driver files.

It is recommended that startup.m script is run first to setup the MATLAB driver appropriately, which will allow the PlutoSDR object to run correctly.

If you notice any errors please create a bug report at: https://github.com/wilab/ece4305/issues
